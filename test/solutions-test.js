 * you visited, you know that there are two nodes linking to
 * that node. Because the back links could be initially messed
 * up in some other way, this algorithm is only correct if you
 * can trust the back links. Otherwise it is just a malformed
 * doubly linked list finder. The singly linked list can even
 * be converted into a doubly linked list with little additional
 * work. Again this will require that we change the structure of
 * the Node to accommodate a second link. Something that may not
 * be possible in all cases. Usually a singly linked list is used
 * because the amount of space to allocate for each node is at a
