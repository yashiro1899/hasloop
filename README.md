# Finding a Loop in a Singly Linked List

Implements most of cases in the article above by Javascript.

A singly linked list is made of nodes where each node has a pointer to the next node (or null to end the list). A singly linked list is often used as a stack (or last in first out queue (LIFO)) because adding a new first element, removing the existing first element, and examining the first element are very fast O(1) operations.

When working with singly linked list, you are typically given a link to the first node. Common operations on a singly linked list are iterating through all the nodes, adding to the list, or deleting from the list. Algorithms for these operations generally require a well formed linked list. That is a linked list without loops or cycles in it.


If a linked list has a cycle:

* The malformed linked list has no end (no node ever has a `null` next node pointer)
* The malformed linked list contains two links to some node
* Iterating through the malformed linked list will yield all nodes in the loop multiple times


A malformed linked list with a loop causes iteration over the list to fail because the iteration will never reach the end of the list. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to detect that a linked list is malformed before trying an iteration. This repository is a collection of various algorithms to detect a loop in a singly linked list.


### Mark Each Node

Traverse the list and mark each node as having been seen.
If you come to a node that has already been marked, then you know that the list has a loop.
The problem with this solution is that all nodes' `seen` properties are set to true.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var current = head;
    do {
        if (current.seen) {
            return true;
        }
        current.seen = true;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Keep a hash set of all nodes seen so far

O(n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity

Keeping a set of all the nodes have seen so far and testing to see if the next node is in that set would be a perfectly correct solution. It would run fast as well. However it would use enough extra space to make a copy of the linked list. Allocating that much memory is prohibitively expensive for large lists.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var nodes = new Set();
    var current = head;

    do {
        if (nodes.has(current)) {
            return true;
        }
        nodes.add(current);
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Use a doubly linked list

O(n) time complexity

Doubly linked lists make it easy to tell if there is a loop. If you encounter any node that doesnâ€™t link to the last node you visited, you know that there are two nodes linking to that node. Because the back links could be initially messed up in some other way, this algorithm is only correct if you can trust the back links. Otherwise it is just a malformed doubly linked list finder. The singly linked list can even be converted into a doubly linked list with little additional work. Again this will require that we change the structure of the Node to accommodate a second link. Something that may not be possible in all cases. Usually a singly linked list is used because the amount of space to allocate for each node is at a premium.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var current = head;
    var previous = null;
    do {
        if (previous && current.previous !== undefined && previous !== current.previous) {
            return true;
        }
        if (current.previous === undefined) {
            current.previous = previous;
        }
        previous = current;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Check the Entire List So Far

O(n^2) time complexity

For each node, assume that the portion of the list examined so for has no loops and check to see if the next node creates a loop by iterating again over the entire list up to that point.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var current = head.next;
    var i = 0;
    var check;
    var j;
    do {
        check = head;
        j = 0;
        do {
            if (check === current) {
                return true;
            }
            j += 1;
            check = check.next;
        } while (j < i && check);
        i += 1;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Reverse the list

O(n) time complexity  If you reverse the list, and remember the inital node, you will know that there is a cycle if you get back to the first node. While efficient, this solution changes the list. Reversing the list twice would put the list back in its initial state, however this solution is not appropriate for multi-threaded applications. In some cases there may not be a way to modify nodes. Since changing the nodes is not needed to get the answer, this solution is not recommended.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var previous = null;
    var current = head;
    var next;

    if (!current.next) {
        return false;
    }
    while (current) {
        next = current.next;
        current.next = previous;
        previous = current;
        current = next;
    }
    return (previous === head);
};
```
