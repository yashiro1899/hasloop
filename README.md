# Finding a Loop in a Singly Linked List

Reference: [http://blog.ostermiller.org/find-loop-singly-linked-list](http://blog.ostermiller.org/find-loop-singly-linked-list 'reference')

Implements most of cases in the article above by Javascript.

A singly linked list is made of nodes where each node has a pointer to the next node (or null to end the list). A singly linked list is often used as a stack (or last in first out queue (LIFO)) because adding a new first element, removing the existing first element, and examining the first element are very fast O(1) operations.

When working with singly linked list, you are typically given a link to the first node. Common operations on a singly linked list are iterating through all the nodes, adding to the list, or deleting from the list. Algorithms for these operations generally require a well formed linked list. That is a linked list without loops or cycles in it.


If a linked list has a cycle:

* The malformed linked list has no end (no node ever has a `null` next node pointer)
* The malformed linked list contains two links to some node
* Iterating through the malformed linked list will yield all nodes in the loop multiple times


A malformed linked list with a loop causes iteration over the list to fail because the iteration will never reach the end of the list. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to detect that a linked list is malformed before trying an iteration. This repository is a collection of various algorithms to detect a loop in a singly linked list.


### Mark Each Node

Traverse the list and mark each node as having been seen.
If you come to a node that has already been marked, then you know that the list has a loop.
The problem with this solution is that all nodes' `seen` properties are set to true.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var current = head;
    do {
        if (current.seen) {
            return true;
        }
        current.seen = true;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Keep a hash set of all nodes seen so far

O(n) time complexity, O(n) space complexity

Keeping a set of all the nodes have seen so far and testing to see if the next node is in that set would be a perfectly correct solution. It would run fast as well. However it would use enough extra space to make a copy of the linked list. Allocating that much memory is prohibitively expensive for large lists.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var nodes = new Set();
    var current = head;

    do {
        if (nodes.has(current)) {
            return true;
        }
        nodes.add(current);
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Use a doubly linked list

O(n) time complexity

Doubly linked lists make it easy to tell if there is a loop. If you encounter any node that doesn't link to the last node you visited, you know that there are two nodes linking to that node. Because the back links could be initially messed up in some other way, this algorithm is only correct if you can trust the back links. Otherwise it is just a malformed doubly linked list finder. The singly linked list can even be converted into a doubly linked list with little additional work. Again this will require that we change the structure of the Node to accommodate a second link. Something that may not be possible in all cases. Usually a singly linked list is used because the amount of space to allocate for each node is at a premium.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var current = head;
    var previous = null;
    do {
        if (previous && current.previous !== undefined && previous !== current.previous) {
            return true;
        }
        if (current.previous === undefined) {
            current.previous = previous;
        }
        previous = current;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Check the Entire List So Far

O(n^2) time complexity

For each node, assume that the portion of the list examined so for has no loops and check to see if the next node creates a loop by iterating again over the entire list up to that point.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var current = head.next;
    var i = 0;
    var check;
    var j;
    do {
        check = head;
        j = 0;
        do {
            if (check === current) {
                return true;
            }
            j += 1;
            check = check.next;
        } while (j < i && check);
        i += 1;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```


### Reverse the list

O(n) time complexity  If you reverse the list, and remember the initial node, you will know that there is a cycle if you get back to the first node. While efficient, this solution changes the list. Reversing the list twice would put the list back in its initial state, however this solution is not appropriate for multi-threaded applications. In some cases there may not be a way to modify nodes. Since changing the nodes is not needed to get the answer, this solution is not recommended.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var previous = null;
    var current = head;
    var next;

    if (!current.next) {
        return false;
    }
    while (current) {
        next = current.next;
        current.next = previous;
        previous = current;
        current = next;
    }
    return (previous === head);
};
```


### Use Memory Allocation Information

O(n) time complexity in the amount of memory on the computer

Some programming languages allow you to see meta information about each node â€” the memory address at which it is allocated. Because each node has a unique numeric address, it is possible to use this information to detect cycles. For this algorithm, keep track of the minimum memory address seen, the maximum memory address seen, and the number of nodes seen. If more nodes have been seen than can fit in the address space then some node must have been seen twice and there is a cycle.

```c
bool hasloop(node_t * head) {
    node_t * current = head;
    uintptr_t min =  (uintptr_t) current;
    uintptr_t max = min + 0x10;
    uintptr_t nodes = 0;
    while (current != NULL) {
        nodes++;
        if ((uintptr_t) current < min) min = (uintptr_t) current;
        if ((uintptr_t) current > max) max = (uintptr_t) current;
        if (max - min < nodes) return true;
        current = current->next;
    }
    return false;
}
```

This algorithm relies on being able to see memory address information. This is not possible to implement in some programming languages such as Javascript that do not make this information available. So I didn't implement this algorithm. It is likely that the entire list will be allocated close together in memory. In such a case the implementation will run close to the running time of the length of the list. However, if the nodes in the list are allocated over a large memory space, the runtime of this algorithm could be much greater than some of the best solutions.


### Catch Larger and Larger Loops

O(n) time complexity

Always store some node to check. Occasionally reset this node to avoid the "Detect Only Full Loops" problem. When resetting it, double the amount of time before resetting it again.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var current = head;
    var check = null;
    var since = 0;
    var sinceScale = 2;
    do {
        if (check === current) {
            return true;
        }
        if (since >= sinceScale) {
            check = current;
            since = 0;
            sinceScale *= 2;
        }
        since += 1;
        current = current.next;
    } while (current);
    return false;
};
```

This solution is O(n) because `sinceScale` grows linearly with the number of calls to next(). Once `sinceScale` is greater than the size of the loop, another n calls to next() may be required to detect the loop. This solution requires up to 3 traversals of the list.

This solution was devised by Stephen Ostermiller and proven O(n) by Daniel Martin.


### Catch Loops in Two Passes

O(n) time complexity

Simultaneously go through the list by ones (slow iterator) and by twos (fast iterator). If there is a loop the fast iterator will go around that loop twice as fast as the slow iterator. The fast iterator will lap the slow iterator within a single pass through the cycle. Detecting a loop is then just detecting that the slow iterator has been lapped by the fast iterator.

```javascript
hasloop = function (head) {
    var slow = head;
    var fast1 = head;
    var fast2 = head;

    do {
        fast1 = fast2 && fast2.next;
        fast2 = fast1 && fast1.next;
        if (slow === fast1 || slow === fast2) {
            return true;
        }
        slow = slow.next;
    } while (slow && fast1 && fast2);
    return false;
};
```

This solution is "Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm" as published in "Non-deterministic Algorithms" by Robert W. Floyd in 1967. It is also called "The Tortoise and the Hare Algorithm".
